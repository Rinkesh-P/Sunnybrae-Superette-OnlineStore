<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>
     Welcome to the Sunnybrae Superette Online Store, a project dedicated to honing
     my skills in software development as well as working with some database tools.
     I mainly took on this project to challenge myself to create a comprehensive
     full-stack application from start to finish. This project marks my return to
     coding and my first solo venture outside of an academic scope, into full-stack
     development.
</p>
<br> 





<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
     Iâ€™m passionate about software development, data analysis, and business
     analytics, with a strong background in Computer Science, Information Systems,
     and Business Analytics. Python is my strongest programming language, which is
     why I decided to develop my first project in Python. This project is my first
     major undertaking in full-stack development, with a little bit of data
     cleaning.
</p>
<br> 


<h3>Learning Experience</h3>
<p>
     Throughout this project, I revisited fundamental concepts of software
     development and learned new technologies, including Django for backend
     development and front-end integration. I also worked with JavaScript for
     button functionality and OnClick events. Additionally, I gained experience in
     data manipulation by converting an XML data set into an SQL database using
     Python pandas.
</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

     While the current focus is on implementing core features, future plans for
     this project include enhancing the user interface with better styling and
     visuals, adding more information to the order confirmation process, and
     including product images. Additionally, I plan to implement features such as
     product reviews, discounts, order tracking, and stock level visibility to
     provide a richer shopping experience.
